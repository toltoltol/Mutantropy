# What you are trying to achieve?
Player controlled projectile firing 
and enemy automatic projectile firing with rudimentary aim bot 

# Who worked on the prototype?
Toby

# How long the prototype took to complete.
3 hours


# What decisions did you make based on the prototype? What worked, what didn't?
Implemented controls as arrow keys for controlling shooting action and direction. 
- This proved to be more complex than expected as reading 2 keys at the same time 
  doesn't work well when just sampling for both keys during update (1 frame) 
- It is really fun and feels good using wasd for movement arrow keys for attacking
- The direction shots move in can feel off when moving in shooting direction

Implemented shooting for both enemy types (ranged and close)
- It works they shoot at the player and the script isn't impossible for a designer to use
- What didn't work well was trying include player movement into where enemies aim
  the issue being im not sure how to expose player movement to the enemy gameobjects scripts 

# What new questions / prototypes arose from this one?
Solving the aimbot problem
- Id like to make prototypes testing different ways of passing player movement direction 
to enemy scripts to allow them to aim at where the player is going
-- Either by just reading input keys in enemy attack scripts and estimating players movement
-- Or by exposing more of player script to enemy gameobjects scripts
