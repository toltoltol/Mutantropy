They must make their way through locked doors and dead ends to find the final room, where many mutagen crystals lie guarded by an extremely powerful mutant.

- Enemy1 (green enemy with big arm) freezes for the first second or so when entering a room with it
- Enemies can get stuck on each other or on nothing making them much easier to attack
